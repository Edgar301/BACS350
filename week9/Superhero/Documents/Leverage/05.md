When referring to Venom in the Prime Marvel Universe, you are likely referring to the Venom Symbiote itself, a symbiotic organism from another planet who feeds on adrenaline and grants spider-like powers to its owner.

You may also be referring to conflicted anti-hero Eddie Brock, the third recipient of the Venom Symbiote after Tel-Kar, and Peter Parker.

Because symbiotes do not exclusively bond to one being, a number of people have worn the symbiote over the years, taking along with it the "Venom" name. Notable among them are former Army Ranger Lee Price, formerly using the symbiote to embark on a career as a super villain; Army Corporal Flash Thompson, formerly using the organism as an agent of the United States government and a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy; and career criminal Mac Gargan, operating with the Symbiote as a member of the Thunderbolts and the Dark Avengers.
