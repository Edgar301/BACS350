## History of the Wade Wilson

Deadpool first appeared in The New Mutants #98 in February 1991. Rob Liefeld came up with the character's design and name while Nicieza came up with Deadpool's speech mannerisms. Liefeld, who was a fan of Teen Titans, showed the character to Fabian. Upon examination, Liefeld that "he was Deathstroke from Teen Titans", and gave him the real name of "Wade Wilson" as a reference to Slade Wilson, aka Deathstroke. Yet another inspiration to Deadpool was Spider-Man, who would make jokes during fights as well. Deadpool is a character that is related to multiple superheros.
